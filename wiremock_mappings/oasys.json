She had said that the deal to purchase cannabis had been set up by a third party and that he had not met the victim prior to the offence.  She recalled paying for cannabis only to find that it had been clearly mixed with cooking herbs 9sage) and getting into an altercation which escalated when the victim refused to reimburse him. She admitted to instigating violence in the first place by punching the victim, out of a mixture of frustration and anger. She said that the situation quickly got out of control when the victim produced a metal bar and hit him with it.",
