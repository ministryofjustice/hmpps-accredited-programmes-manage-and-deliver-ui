She said that in the past she had generally worked on an intermittent, ad hoc basis; including employment as a labourer, carpenter and road worker. Ms Puckett told me that she was last employed in 2004.  She spoke of wanting to secure suitable employment although she knows that she will first need to fully address her drug issues.",

Together, Ms Puckett and the other man queried the quality of the ounce of cannabis. Ms Puckett asked for her money back.  Mr X told them there was nothing wrong with the cannabis and asked them both to leave. Ms Puckett grabbed Mr X and said she wanted her money back.  Mr X said something.  Ms Puckett then punched him once with her fist. Mr X then attacked Ms Puckett with an implement from the side or the back of the sofa. He struck Ms Puckett to the back of the head.

She recalled paying for cannabis only to find that it had been clearly mixed with cooking herbs 9sage) and getting into an altercation which escalated when the victim refused to reimburse him.

This meeting had been pre- arranged and Ms Puckett went there with another man. Mr X sold an ounce of cannabis for #120 to Ms Puckett.  Together, Ms Puckett and the other man queried the quality of the ounce of cannabis. Ms Puckett asked for her money back.  Mr X told them there was nothing wrong with the cannabis and asked them both to leave. Ms Puckett grabbed Mr X and said she wanted her money back.  Mr X said something.  Ms Puckett then punched him once with her fist. Mr X then attacked Ms Puckett with an implement from the side or the back of the sofa. He struck Ms Puckett to the back of the head. In the course of the struggle Ms Puckett accepts that he came into possession of the implement with shich Mr X had attacked her. During the course of the struggle Ms Puckett accepts that she struck Mr X with the implement 2 or 3 times. As a result she is guilty of unlawful wounding.",

She had said that the deal to purchase cannabis had been set up by a third party and that he had not met the victim prior to the offence.  She recalled paying for cannabis only to find that it had been clearly mixed with cooking herbs 9sage) and getting into an altercation which escalated when the victim refused to reimburse him. She admitted to instigating violence in the first place by punching the victim, out of a mixture of frustration and anger. She said that the situation quickly got out of control when the victim produced a metal bar and hit him with it.",

          "patternOffending": "Mr Smith has an unenviable record of 25 previous convictions recorded to his detriment, relating to 68 offences. These date back to when he would have been aged 17.  The majority of these have been for theft and kindred offences, reflecting a pattern of acquisitive offending inextricably linked to drug use. In the past he has received virtually the full gamut of sentencing options available to the courts and he is no stranger to the prison system. He has previously served two relatively lengthy sentences (03/10/2001 ? 5 years, 15/04/2005 ? 4 years) for offences of Supplying/Being Concerned in the Supply of Class A drugs. In relation to the nature of the current offence, Mr Smith has one earlier conviction for an offence of wounding (section 20) which he received 9 months Youth Custody as a result. More recently, he appeared before Northampton Crown Court for an offence of Affray in November 2004 when the matter was dealt with by way of a custodial penalty of 28 days. Mr Smith last appeared before a court on 25/02/2010 for offences of Theft from a Dwelling and Failing to Surrender to Custody at the Appointed Time. The matter resulted in the current Community Order being imposed by the Milton Keynes Magistrates court, comprising a 6 months Supervision Requirement and a Drug Rehabilitation Requirement. It would appear that the current offence represents a concerning escalation in the seriousness of Mr Smith?s offending; his use of violence clearly increases the risk of harm he is assessed as posing.",
          "acceptsResponsibility": "Ms Pucket acknowledged that his response to this particular situation had been disproportionately violent and dangerous.  She commented that he generally disapproves of the use of violence as a means of settling disputes, and consequently she is angry with himself for behaving in such a manner.  She understands that the victim suffered significant injury and that both he and his girlfriend herself the experience deeply distressing. However, her view that the victim had attempted to sell him inferior  cannabis in the first place prevents her from fully accepting responsibility for the offence, or from expressing direct remorse regarding the impact on the victim and his girlfriend.",
