She said that in the past she had generally worked on an intermittent, ad hoc basis; including employment as a labourer, carpenter and road worker. Ms Puckett told me that she was last employed in 2004.  She spoke of wanting to secure suitable employment although she knows that she will first need to fully address her drug issues.",

She recalled paying for cannabis only to find that it had been clearly mixed with cooking herbs 9sage) and getting into an altercation which escalated when the victim refused to reimburse him.
