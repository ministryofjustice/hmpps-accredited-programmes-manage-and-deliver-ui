# Seeded Wiremock Mappings

This directory contains JSON mapping files generated by the API service when the `seeding` Spring profile is active.

The API service writes `seeded-person-$CRN.json` files here via a shared Docker volume, and wiremock automatically picks them up.

## How it works

1. The API container mounts this directory at `/app/wiremock_mappings/seeded`
2. When you trigger the seeding endpoint, JSON files are written here
3. Wiremock reads from `./wiremock_mappings` (parent directory) and picks up these files automatically

## Important

This directory is excluded from git (see `.gitignore`) as the files are generated dynamically during development.
